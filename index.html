    <p>Hey i'm Adeyemi, I'm a Software Engineer based in Toronto,üá®üá¶ Canada. 
        With a deep-rooted fascination for all things tech.</p>
        <p>At the core of my journey lies a commitment to continuous learning and improvement.
         I've honed my skills and knowledge in the realm of Cloud Computing and devops by achieving certifications 
         such as AWS Certified Solutions Architect, HashiCorp Certified Terraform Associate and the Certified Kubernetes Administrator. These certifications serve as 
         a testament to my dedication to mastering the art 
        of architecting and managing scalable, secure, and efficient solutions.
        However, i see DevOps as the bridge that connects software development and IT operations,
         transforming the way organizations build, test, and deploy applications. DevOps represents not just a
          methodology, but a culture that fosters collaboration and automation. I'm deeply 
          invested in leveraging cutting-edge DevOps tools and practices to streamline processes, 
          increase efficiency, and deliver high-quality software solutions.
    </p>
        <p>Outside of tech, i am interested in hospitality and mixology. 
            I love crafting excellent cocktails and providing top-notch customer service behind the bar. 
            My favorite cocktail is the Mojito. </p>
